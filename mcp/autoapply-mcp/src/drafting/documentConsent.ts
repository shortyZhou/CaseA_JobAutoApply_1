/**
 * Telling a consent to a document apart from a claim about the candidate.
 *
 * A required choice offering exactly one option carries no decision, and the
 * drafting layer already resolves those rather than blocking an application
 * over a field with nothing else to select. That rule is deliberately withheld
 * from sensitive categories, because there a lone "I certify..." can state a
 * fact: "I certify that I have never been convicted of a felony" is a single
 * option, reads as a formality, and is a false claim if untrue.
 *
 * The category is the wrong thing to discriminate on. IonQ's Greenhouse form
 * asks "Background Check Disclosure & Consent" and offers exactly one option,
 * "I agree and acknowledge to the IonQ Background Check Disclosure and
 * Consent." That classifies as criminal-history and so blocked the whole
 * application, yet it discloses nothing: it consents to a process the employer
 * will run later. The privacy notice immediately above it on the same form,
 * identical in kind, resolved fine only because it happened to classify as a
 * legal attestation.
 *
 * What actually separates the two is the object of the verb. Consenting to a
 * *document or process* - a notice, a policy, a disclosure, an authorization,
 * a background check - reveals nothing. Asserting something *about the
 * candidate* does. So a sole option in a sensitive category is taken only when
 * it names a document and makes no personal claim.
