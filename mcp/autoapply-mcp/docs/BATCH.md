# Batch applications

Preparing a hundred applications one at a time does not work in practice. The batch tools handle volume without weakening the approval boundary: every per-application guard still runs, and approval binds to a manifest hash covering the whole set.

## The flow

```
prepare_batch   select from the queue, prepare a packet for each
preview_batch   review the set and the grouped blocking questions
approve_batch   one decision authorizing the whole manifest
submit_batch    submit the set, honouring daily limit and pacing
list_batches    track progress
```

## prepare_batch

Selects queued jobs matching a filter and prepares each one through the same code path as `prepare_application`.

| Filter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tiers` | Quality tiers. Defaults to `["A","B"]` |
| `trackIds` | Campaign tracks to include |
| `locationClasses` | e.g. `["bay-area","canada","remote-canada"]` |
| `companies` | Restrict to named employers |
| `minScore` | Minimum score |
| `minCompensation` | Minimum annualized top-of-range pay, campaign currency |
| `allowUnknownCompensation` | Include postings with no published pay. Default false |
| `limit` | Max applications to prepare. Default 50, max 300 |

Applications split into two states:

- **ready** - every question is answered from verified data or a pre-approved answer
- **needs_human** - at least one question needs a decision, or the resume is unusable

Only `ready` applications enter the manifest. `blockingReasons` groups the outstanding questions by category so one profile edit can clear many applications at once.

## Why a manifest hash

Single approval binds to one packet hash. Batch approval binds to a hash of every packet in the set, sorted by application id. If any application changes, or one is added or removed, the manifest no longer matches and approval is refused.

`approve_batch` also requires `expectedCount`. Passing the hash alone would let a batch that silently grew be approved by replay; requiring the count means the number is confirmed by a person who has seen it.

## Where your data lives

Keep personal data outside the repository. The server's default home is `~/.autoapply`, which is where profile, campaign, resumes, database and artifacts belong:

```
~/.autoapply/
  profile.json        identity, personal data, answers, narratives
  campaign.json       tracks, gates, scoring, submission policy
  companies.json      ATS board list
  resumes/            the files actually uploaded
  data/               SQLite database
  artifacts/          screenshots and submission evidence
```

Nothing in the repository is specific to one candidate, so a checkout can be published without stripping anything. `config/` is gitignored as a convenience for local experiments, but the safer habit is to keep real data in `~/.autoapply` and point `AUTOAPPLY_HOME` there.

## Ordered preference lists

Employers ask the same question with different option sets. "How did you hear about us?" might offer "Referral", "Employee referral" or "Word of mouth" for the same underlying answer, and a stored string that matches none of them cannot be submitted.

`alternatives` is an ordered preference list. The first entry the employer actually offers is used:

```json
{
  "key": "source",
  "patterns": ["how did you hear", "where have you learned about"],
  "answer": "Friend",
  "alternatives": [
    "Friend", "Referral", "Employee Referral", "Word of mouth",
    "Company careers page", "Company website", "LinkedIn", "Other"
  ],
  "allowAutoFill": true
}
```

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Free-text field | Top preference, `Friend` |
| Options include `Friend` | `Friend` |
| Options are `LinkedIn`, `Job board`, `Company careers page` | `Company careers page` |
| Options are `Indeed`, `Glassdoor` | Handed back, with the offered options in `guidance` |

Preference order is primary and match quality secondary, so a first choice of "Referral" beats an exact "LinkedIn" option lower in the list. Matching ignores case and punctuation, and an option that contains a preference counts as a match, so "Employee Referral (current employee)" matches "Employee Referral".

## Overriding a general answer for one employer

Pattern matching prefers the longest match, so a specific entry beats a general one without needing rules about ordering:

```json
{ "key": "employed-before",    "patterns": ["worked for", "been employed by"], "answer": "No" }
{ "key": "employed-microsoft", "patterns": ["worked for microsoft", "employed by microsoft"], "answer": "Yes" }
```

"Have you ever worked for this company?" answers `No`, while "Have you been employed by Microsoft?" answers `Yes`.

## Reducing what needs a human

The lever is `profile.answers` and `profile.personal`. Every question you pre-answer removes that question from every future application.

After a `prepare_batch` run, read `blockingReasons` for the category counts and `recurringQuestions` for the exact question text:

```json
"recurringQuestions": [
  { "count": 5, "category": "general", "label": "AI Policy for Application",
    "suggested": "", "guidance": "Read the employer's exact policy..." },
  { "count": 3, "category": "general", "label": "Where have you learned about us?" }
]
```

One entry added to `profile.answers` clears every application that asks the same thing. Run `reload_config`, then `prepare_batch` again.

### Suggestions on questions that stay with you

An entry with `allowAutoFill: false` still supplies its `answer` as a **suggestion** and its `note` as **guidance**, so a question that needs your decision does not arrive as a blank field:

```json
{
  "key": "ai-policy",
  "patterns": ["ai policy", "did you use ai"],
  "answer": "",
  "allowAutoFill": false,
  "note": "Read the employer's exact policy on the application page before answering..."
}
```

Both surface in `prepare_application` under `questionsNeedingHuman`, and in `preview_batch` under each application's `outstanding`.

This is the right shape for attestations about the application itself. Whether AI assistance was used is a fact only you can attest to, and some employers - Anthropic among them - explicitly ask for unmediated writing on questions like "Why this company?". Where an employer asks that, write that answer yourself rather than relying on a narrative template.

`essay` questions are never pre-answered: a generic answer to "why do you want to work here" is worse than none.

## Work authorization

Three lists describe where you can work, and they mean different things:

```json
"workAuthorization": {
  "citizenships": ["Canada"],
  "authorizedIn": ["CA"],
  "noSponsorshipRequiredIn": ["US"],
  "requiresSponsorshipIn": [],
  "statement": "...",
  "alwaysReviewManually": false
}
```

| Field | Meaning | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `authorizedIn` | Authorized today, no employer action | Gate passes; full scoring credit |
| `noSponsorshipRequiredIn` | Can obtain authorization without employer sponsorship, e.g. a Canadian using TN under USMCA | Gate passes even when the posting says it will not sponsor; 90% scoring credit |
| `requiresSponsorshipIn` | Employer must petition | Gate rejects postings that rule out sponsorship |

Separating the middle case matters. A blanket "authorized" claim is inaccurate for someone who has not yet entered on TN, while treating TN as ordinary sponsorship discards employers who simply will not file an H-1B.

Citizenship and clearance requirements still gate out regardless: no visa route satisfies "must be a U.S. citizen" or "must hold TS/SCI".

### Answering sponsorship questions

Set `alwaysReviewManually: false` and add matching entries to `profile.answers` with `allowAutoFill: true`.

Employers phrase this several ways and the phrasings do not mean the same thing. Real examples from live boards:

| Question | Consideration |
|---|---|
| "Do you require visa sponsorship?" | TN needs no petition or lottery, so "No" is defensible |
| "...require sponsorship (e.g., H-1B, E-3, **TN**, O-1...) requiring a written submission to a government agency?" | This definition **includes TN**. "No" would be false here |
| "Are you a U.S. Person (Citizen, LPR, Refugee, Asylee)?" | A separate factual question, usually export-control related |
| "Are you legally authorized to work in the country where the job is located?" | Country-relative; the answer changes with the posting |

Because these overlap, the longest matching pattern wins rather than the first, so a specific answer is never pre-empted by a generic one. Write a distinct entry for each phrasing you care about.

These are legal attestations on a document you sign. Confirm your wording with an immigration lawyer, and remember that Form I-9 verifies status at onboarding.

## Narrative templates

`profile.narratives` answers open-ended questions such as "Why this company?" and cover-letter fields without either storing boilerplate or letting a model invent something.

```json
"narratives": [{
  "key": "why-company",
  "label": "Why this company?",
  "patterns": ["why {company}", "why do you want to work", "cover letter"],
  "template": "I have spent five years building security infrastructure... {company}'s work on {topics} lines up with that, and {role} is where I would apply it.",
  "allowAutoFill": true,
  "minTopics": 1
}]
```

| Placeholder | Filled with |
|---|---|
| `{company}` | Employer name |
| `{role}` | Job title |
| `{topics}` | Keywords the posting asks for **that your profile actually supports** |
| `{location}` | Posting location |

`{company}` also works inside `patterns`, so one entry matches "Why Anthropic?", "Why Stripe?" and the generic phrasings.

`topics` is drawn from the match report and excludes anything in `claimsToAvoid`, so a template cannot claim experience you do not have. `minTopics` declines to render when the posting produced too little to say something specific — a handed-back question is better than a generic paragraph.

A template is not a substitute for a real cover letter on roles you care most about. It is a reasonable floor for volume.

## Personal and demographic data

`profile.personal` caches the details most forms require. Every field has its own `autoFill` flag, and **nothing is sent unless that flag is true**. Storing a value is not consent to send it.

```json
"personal": {
  "dateOfBirth": { "value": "1990-01-01", "autoFill": false },
  "address": { "street": "...", "city": "...", "region": "...", "postalCode": "...", "country": "..." },
  "addressAutoFill": true,
  "legalAgeConfirmation": { "value": "Yes", "autoFill": true },
  "previousEmployment": { "value": "No", "autoFill": false },
  "demographics": {
    "gender": { "value": "Decline to self-identify", "autoFill": true },
    "pronouns": { "value": "", "autoFill": false },
    "raceEthnicity": { "value": "Decline to self-identify", "autoFill": true },
    "hispanicLatino": { "value": "Decline to self-identify", "autoFill": true },
    "veteranStatus": { "value": "I am not a protected veteran", "autoFill": true },
    "disabilityStatus": { "value": "I do not wish to answer", "autoFill": true },
    "sexualOrientation": { "value": "Decline to self-identify", "autoFill": true },
    "transgenderIdentity": { "value": "Decline to self-identify", "autoFill": true }
  }
}
```

US self-identification questions are voluntary. "Decline to self-identify" is a legitimate answer and a safe default; supplying real values is equally valid and entirely your choice. Either way the decision is recorded once rather than being asked a hundred times.

`personal` is redacted from logs and audit payloads, and `config/` is gitignored.

## Deliberately blank answers

Optional free-text fields such as "Additional Information" are often better empty than filled with something generic. Recording that as a decision stops them blocking every application:

```json
{ "key": "additional-information", "patterns": ["additional information"], "answer": "", "skip": true }
```

`skip` is the difference between "I decided to leave this blank" and "nobody has looked at this yet". A blank answer without `skip` still stops for a human.

## Submission

`submit_batch` re-runs every guard per application and respects `dailyLimit` and `minDelaySeconds`. When the daily cap is hit it stops cleanly and marks the rest `deferred`; call it again the next day to continue.

| Mode | Result |
|---|---|
| `manual` | Returns apply URLs and packets for you to submit, then call `record_submission` |
| `assisted` | Fills each hosted form in a visible browser for you to review and submit |
| `auto` | Fills and submits. Requires campaign mode `auto` and an allowlisted company |

A CAPTCHA, an unfillable required field, or an off-allowlist redirect marks that application `needs_human` and the batch continues.

## Realistic volume

Batch size is limited by your queue, not the tool. Before promising yourself a number, measure it:

```
list_queue with your filter and limit 200 -> count
```

If the count is far below your target, the honest fixes are: add more company boards, widen `locationClasses`, lower `minCompensation`, or include tier C with review. Lowering the bar to hit a number is a choice worth making consciously.
